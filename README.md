# TNetFoss

A telnet server with virtual modems that acts as a fossil driver for MS-DOS BBS systems that only work with serial ports/modems and don't have an integrated telnet option.

OS/2 has SIO:

MS-DOS only has a slow and limited (4) connection working solution called RLFOSSIL which is quite buggy:
